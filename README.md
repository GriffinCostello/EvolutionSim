# Evolution Simulation

This is a simple agent-based simulation of organisms in a 2D world.  

## Current Features
- Single organisms (e.g., Leo the Lion) move randomly or toward nearby food.
- Organisms consume energy over time; moving costs energy.
- Food can be detected within a vision radius.
- Eating restores energy; organisms die if energy reaches 0.

## Future Plans
- Multiple organisms and population dynamics
- Reproduction and genetic variation
- Smarter foraging strategies and emergent behaviors

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. Run `simulation.py` in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python simulation.py
