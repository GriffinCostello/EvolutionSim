# 2024-12-22 — Baseline Run

## Parameters
- World size: 1000×1000
- Food spawn: One food every 200 places
- Initial organisms: 100
- Initial Organism Features
    - age = random.randint(1, 10),
    - energy = random.randint(40,60),
    - traits
        - detectionRadius = 30,
        - speed = 8,
        - energyCapacity = 250,
        - birthEnergy = 80,
        - slowDownAge = 30,
        - reproductionAge = 20,
        - matingCallRadius = 200,
        - digestionTime = 8,
        - generation = 1

## Observations
- Population halves by ~100 ticks
- The Population then starts dying off again steadily
- Speed ALWAYS reaches the minimum value (1)
    - I suspect that this is because energy consumption is proportional to speed
    - A lack of predators means there is not much reason for speed much like galapagos tortoises

## Stats
- Average life span typically sits somewhere around 160-180
- Slow down age typically increases to 32-35
- Reproduction age dcreases by 1 or 2 ticks, 18-19
- Energy for birth also decreases to 72-78

## Hypotheses
- A lack of predators and need for speed results in a slow population
- There is not enough food or time for the speices to be able to live long enough to see large changes

## Next things to try
- Add predators to kill slower members
- This will let us observe trophic levels and how populations balance by number of predators and prey
- Give food more energy to allow for creatures to live longer
