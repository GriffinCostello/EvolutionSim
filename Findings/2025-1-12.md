# 2025-1-12 — Predators Run

## Parameters
- World size: 1000×1000
- Food spawn: One food every 300 places
- Initial organisms: 1000 Herbivores, 100 Carnivores
- Initial Herbivore Traits
    - age = random.randint(1, 20),
    - energy = random.randint(150,200),
    - traits
        - foodDetectionRadius = 30,
        - predatorDetectionRadius = 10,
        - speed = 6,
        - energyCapacity = 500,
        - birthEnergy = 80,
        - slowDownAge = 60,
        - reproductionAge = 20,
        - matingCallRadius = 200,
        - digestionTime = 5,
        - generation = 1
- Initial Carnivore Traits
    - age = random.randint(1, 20),
    - energy = random.randint(150,200),
    - traits
        - huntingRadius = 30,
        - speed = 8,
        - energyCapacity = 500,
        - birthEnergy = 80,
        - slowDownAge = 60,
        - reproductionAge = 20,
        - matingCallRadius = 200,
        - digestionTime = 5,
        - generation = 1


## Observations
- Population is now observed by generations rather than ticks
- Speed ALWAYS reaches the minimum value (1)
    - Now it reaches this at a far slower rate, taking 20 generations instead of about 7
    - Adding predators creates a need for speed, allowing faster members to survive longer
    - However, many members still end up at the minimum speed likely due to energy costs and lack of sufficient predation pressure

## Stats
- Average life span typically sits somewhere around 120-300 generations
- Average herbivore life span is 80-150 ticks
- Average carnivore life span is 60-80 ticks
- Reproduction age decreases over time to around 17 ticks
- All other stats remain similar to the baseline run, as there is not much evolutionary pressure on them yet

## Hypotheses
- Adding predators creates evolutionary pressure for speed, allowing herbivores to survive longer
- However, energy costs and insufficient predation pressure still lead to many herbivores evolving to minimum speed

## Next things to try
- Increase the quality and quantity of food to allow herbivores to live longer and see more evolutionary changes
    - This should also help carnivores live longer as well
- Make herbivores detect the closest carnivore rather than a random one within their detection radius
    - This should create more consistent evolutionary pressure for speed
